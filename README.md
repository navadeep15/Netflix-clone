# Netflix-clone
A clone of Netflix website

This project is a simplified front-end clone of Netflix. It aims to replicate the visual aspects of the official Netflix homepage using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript for minimal interactivity. This clone allows users to interact with a frontend similar to the Netflix landing page, providing a hands-on example for learning HTML and CSS techniques.

1) Clone the repository to your local machine using the command git clone
2) Navigate to the cloned repository and run the netflix.html file
